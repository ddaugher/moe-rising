Let’s be real—I wasn’t always the most punctual person. Early in my career and as a new mom, I thought I could cram an impossible number of things into way too little time. Spoiler alert: it didn’t work. The result? I was that person—always running late, with kids (and everyone else) rolling their eyes. It wasn’t a great look.
Then one day, someone hit me with this gem: “If you’re not five minutes early, you’re late.” Another favorite: “Prior planning prevents poor performance.” At the time, those words were about as welcome as nails on a chalkboard. But here’s the thing: they’re true.
Now, I’ve come to embrace that phrase as my golden rule of getting things done. And trust me, it’s a game-changer.

### Prior: The Art of Being Ready
"Prior" simply means before—as in doing something ahead of time instead of scrambling at the last minute. Whether it’s studying for an exam days in advance or mapping out a road trip before you hit the highway, taking action early builds confidence. It’s about being ready before you even need to be.
Think about it: when you prepare for a meeting in advance, it stays on track. When you set your clothes out the night before, you skip the morning panic. Small steps, big impact.

### Planning: The Blueprint for Success
Planning is the process of making those “before” moments happen. Benjamin Franklin nailed it: “Failing to plan is planning to fail.”
Whether it’s cooking dinner, tackling a work project, or simply fitting in a workout, having a plan means you’re setting yourself up for success. Without one? Well, let’s just say chaos isn’t a great productivity strategy.

### Why Now Is the Perfect Time
Every December, I sit down to plan for the year ahead. Travel, learning, home projects, work goals—you name it, I map it out. I’ve learned that the goals I actually achieve are the ones I plan for. A list is great, but without action and preparation, it’s just wishful thinking.
So as we close out the year, take a moment to reflect. What do you want to accomplish? How can you set yourself up for success? Maybe it’s time to make punctuality your thing (it’s never too late to shed the “chronically late” label!).
Prior planning isn’t just a phrase; it’s the foundation for achieving anything worth doing. Take it from someone who learned the hard way—it’s absolutely worth it.
