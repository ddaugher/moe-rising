We are thrilled to share that over the past year, augustwenty has had the privilege of sponsoring the Ohio University Sparkles.
This incredible organization, led by Ohio University students, is the university’s Inclusive Spirit Squad. Their mission is to promote acceptance and inclusion, showing that at OHIO,
everyone belongs.

Our involvement with Sparkles began when our employee, Emma Daugherty, introduced us to this inspiring group. When asked why she joined Sparkles and why she believed augustwenty should support
them,

Emma shared: I decided to join Sparkles because I wanted my time at Ohio University to be about something bigger than myself. Sparkles is more than cheering on the sidelines at OU games; it’s about the
lifelong friendships we’ve built. We’re all best friends, and no matter what challenges I face—a bad day or stressful homework—Sparkles practice is a place where I can let go and have fun with
my teammates. Since Sparkles is considered a club at Ohio University, we don’t receive funding from the school. When I learned we needed new pom-poms and uniforms for our growing team, I knew
exactly who to ask for help. Ohio Sparkles and augustwenty’s values align perfectly—both are rooted in fostering inclusivity, building meaningful connections, and creating a supportive community
where everyone can thrive. Knowing augustwenty’s commitment to supporting impactful initiatives, I felt confident reaching out. Their generosity not only helped us purchase the pom-poms we needed
but also reminded us that we’re not alone in our mission. This support has strengthened our ability to represent inclusivity on campus and has shown our team how much a community can achieve when
it comes together for a shared purpose.
