In this conversation, DJ and Mary discuss their caffeine preferences, with DJ favoring Mountain Dew and Mary enjoying a vitamin-infused drink called Spark. They both express a dislike for coffee. The dialogue shifts to exciting developments in their company: they've recently landed a new client and successfully hired four new employees, bringing their team size to 36 after four years in operation. Mary is set to lead the onboarding session for the new hires.

The main focus of their discussion centers on the relationship between risk-taking and innovation. DJ introduces the topic by mentioning SpaceX's recent achievements, highlighting how taking significant risks can lead to groundbreaking advancements. Mary emphasizes that the purpose behind taking a risk is crucial; a strong mission can inspire people to put aside personal reservations for a greater cause.

They explore the idea that everyone takes risks daily, such as driving a car, and how what once seemed risky—like air travel—has become routine over time. This leads them to reflect on their own business decisions, acknowledging that hiring new staff is a risk but one that is necessary for growth and innovation.

Mary introduces the concept of reframing failure as a "First Attempt In Learning," encouraging a mindset that values learning from mistakes. She shares an anecdote about how expertise in a specific domain can make daunting tasks achievable, illustrating the importance of confidence and experience in overcoming challenges.

Together, they conclude that innovation doesn't always require monumental changes; small, consistent efforts can lead to significant impact over time. They stress the importance of stepping out of comfort zones, embracing calculated risks, and continually seeking ways to improve both personally and professionally.
