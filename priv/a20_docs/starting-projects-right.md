In this episode of the augustwenty podcast, hosts DJ Daugherty and Mary Kaufmann are joined by delivery and engagement expert Nish Gandhi to discuss the essentials of starting a software development project on the right foot. From setting clear objectives to building an aligned and motivated team, they share practical advice and insights from their experiences. Together, they explore why proper planning, clear communication, and iterative development are crucial for avoiding pitfalls and ensuring project success.

### Starting Strong: Setting Clear Objectives and Understanding Client Goals

Nish, who has led countless successful projects from idea to delivery, emphasizes that the foundation of any project lies in understanding the client's goals and motivations. Before any code is written or development begins, it's vital to ask key questions like:

- What’s the purpose of this project?
- What outcomes are expected?
- What’s the budget, timeline, and company culture?

These questions help establish a shared understanding between the team and the client. Nish stresses the importance of having an initial, pre-kickoff meeting to get insights directly from the client on why they’re undertaking the project and the specific value it should deliver. This early alignment helps ensure that all project decisions will support the client’s ultimate goals, whether they’re looking to streamline operations, expand their market, or revitalize an existing product.

### Building an Aligned Team and Setting Clear Expectations

Mary highlights how critical it is for all team members, especially those focused on engineering, to understand the "why" behind each project. Engineers, project managers, and delivery leads all need to be on the same page about the project’s purpose. DJ emphasizes that teams often jump straight into development, which can lead to missed alignment on priorities and expectations. Without proper context, engineers might focus on technical challenges without fully grasping how their work contributes to the client’s goals.

To counter this, Nish and the augustwenty team use a “big wall of prompts” — a board filled with over 150 considerations collected over decades of project experience. This board serves as a resource, helping project leads pick the most relevant considerations for each unique project, ensuring that critical aspects of the project are covered early on. The team whittles these prompts down to the core ones for each project, tailored to the specific client’s needs and goals. This strategy ensures nothing falls through the cracks, and everyone knows their role, responsibilities, and how their contributions fit into the bigger picture.

### The Importance of Communication and Relationship-Building

Communication is a major theme in this episode, with DJ emphasizing that ongoing dialogue with clients helps keep everyone aligned and motivated. Nish stresses that it’s important to communicate constantly and openly, ensuring that there’s a mutual understanding of progress and any potential roadblocks. Building relationships with clients goes beyond just delivering a product—it’s about creating a collaborative environment where feedback flows freely, and everyone is invested in the project’s success.

Nish shares a memorable example of how a small gesture, like scheduling an initial project meeting, can set the tone for open communication. In one project, Nish took the initiative to schedule a kickoff meeting, which led the client to feel confident and appreciated the proactive approach. This simple step helped clarify expectations around meeting times, progress updates, and reporting, setting the project on a positive course right from the beginning.

Mary brings up the concept of “clear is kind,” emphasizing that establishing clarity in communication avoids misunderstandings and ensures everyone is on the same page. For remote teams especially, regular and intentional communication helps bridge the physical gap, creating a sense of unity and shared purpose.

### Managing Constraints: Time, Budget, and Technology Choices

One of the challenges that DJ points out is the tendency to focus purely on the engineering side and dive straight into coding. While many developers are eager to jump in and start solving technical problems, they must also consider time and budget constraints. In most cases, these constraints require trade-offs and compromises. Mary notes that it’s essential for the team to keep the client’s limitations in mind and to present the client with multiple options, each with different time and cost implications.

Nish highlights that the role of the delivery lead is to manage these constraints thoughtfully, ensuring that the team balances client needs with feasible, high-quality solutions. By offering clients a menu of options and clarifying the implications of each choice, the team empowers clients to make informed decisions. This is especially important in software projects, where technology decisions need to consider both immediate functionality and long-term maintenance.

### Embracing Iterative Development and Remaining Flexible

The augustwenty team uses an iterative approach to software development, where progress is made through regular cycles of building, testing, and feedback. DJ compares this process to building a house: you wouldn’t just start hammering nails without first understanding the full design. Iterative development provides clients with regular checkpoints to assess progress and refine their vision based on what’s been built so far.

Nish shares a story about a client who initially had a clear vision of their project. But as the project evolved, new insights came to light, and the client’s needs shifted. This shift was made possible by maintaining open communication, which allowed the team to pivot efficiently and adapt to the client’s changing requirements. DJ observes that, while iterative development can seem daunting, it’s a natural way for people to work. Just as people constantly adjust their actions in response to new information, iterative development encourages flexibility and responsiveness to emerging client needs.

### Practical Takeaways for a Successful Project Kickoff

The augustwenty team sums up their advice for starting a project on a strong note:

1. Ask the Right Questions Early: Establish a clear understanding of the client’s goals, budget, and timeline before diving in.
1. Build a Collaborative Relationship: Frequent, transparent communication helps ensure everyone is aligned and motivated.
1. Emphasize Iterative Development: Regular check-ins and the flexibility to pivot help accommodate evolving client needs.
1. Manage Expectations on Time and Budget: Clearly communicate the impact of time and budget constraints, and offer clients multiple options to choose from.
1. Keep Communication Open: For remote teams, intentional communication practices are essential to build trust and keep everyone on track.

By following these steps, software teams can ensure that their projects start with a solid foundation. Through careful planning, intentional communication, and a flexible approach, projects can be set up for long-term success. "Clear is kind”, and clarity, communication, and collaboration are at the heart of every successful project kickoff at augustwenty.
