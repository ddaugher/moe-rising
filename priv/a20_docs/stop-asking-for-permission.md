One of the most frustrating dynamics in our work isn’t technical—it’s psychological.

We hire smart, capable software engineers. Talented developers who can architect scalable systems, wrangle legacy codebases, and debug just about anything. But we don’t just hire builders—we hire consultants. People who aren’t just expected to write great code, but to lead. To guide. To solve real problems for our clients.

And yet, over and over again, we face the same question:

> “Am I allowed to do this?”

It shows up in conversations about timelines, process improvements, technical direction, client communication—even in code reviews. And every time it happens, it reveals something deeper: **a fear of ownership**.

We don’t hire engineers to simply build what they’re told. We hire professionals to think, lead, and solve problems—end to end. And when they hesitate to act without permission, the client doesn’t get the leadership they’re paying for.

That’s a problem.

### Why We Hire Engineers Who Can Consult

The difference between a developer and a consultant isn’t intelligence or even technical ability. It’s intent. A developer executes. A consultant diagnoses, recommends, leads, and *delivers outcomes.*

We hire for both roles in one person. And that’s not just a nice-to-have—it’s **our entire value proposition**.

Clients come to us because they’re stuck. They don’t know what to build. Or how to build it. Or where to start. The moment they bring us in, we’re expected to lead the solution.

That means:

- Making calls without someone holding your hand
- Proactively proposing better ways to do things
- Guiding the client through uncertainty—even if they don’t ask you to

And yet, too often, we hear:

> “Should I wait for approval?”
> “Is this something I can just do?”
> “Who’s responsible for deciding this?”

Here’s the answer: **You are.**

If it’s a responsible move that adds value, gets the client unstuck, and delivers forward momentum—then yes, you should do it.

### What’s Really Holding People Back?

Let’s unpack the root of this hesitation. It often stems from one or more of the following:

#### 1. Fear of Doing the Wrong Thing

Engineers are trained to be precise. Many don’t want to make a move that might later be questioned or undone. That’s understandable. But in consulting, perfection is less important than progress. Doing nothing because you’re scared of getting it “slightly wrong” is far more dangerous than doing something with good intent and adjusting later.

#### 2. Lack of Clear Authority

Some engineers are used to rigid hierarchies where decisions always go up the chain. In consulting, that chain is short. If you're in the room, you *are* the chain. We must retrain people to operate from a position of agency, not subordination.

#### 3. The Safety of Consensus

Waiting for group consensus feels safe. But it's also slow. Some decisions don't need a committee. They just need someone to step up, make the call, and take responsibility. That’s the difference between a participant and a leader.

#### 4. Unclear Expectations

If we haven’t made it clear: *we expect our consultants to lead.* Not just code. Not just analyze. But to guide the client toward clarity and delivery. If that expectation feels uncomfortable, it’s time to lean into it, not retreat from it.

### The Permission Culture Is a Drag on Momentum

When we create a culture where people wait to be told what to do, we unintentionally reinforce a mindset of dependency. Every small question gets escalated. Every small roadblock becomes a reason to stall. Every decision becomes a bottleneck.

That’s not consulting. That’s paralysis dressed up as process.

Clients don’t want order-takers. They want accelerators. People who see the path forward and start walking it—**confidently, proactively, and with accountability.**

### Here’s the Rule: Value, Clarity, Momentum

We don’t need every action to be perfect.
We don’t need every decision to be blessed by leadership.

We need action that:

- Moves the client forward
- Creates value
- Brings clarity or removes friction
- Is communicated clearly and professionally
- Can be defended with thoughtful reasoning

If you're operating in that space, **you have our full support**. Even if it doesn’t work perfectly the first time.

### What Does Initiative Look Like?

Initiative isn’t about grand gestures. It’s about small, confident moves that demonstrate ownership:

- Seeing a broken process and proposing a better one
- Making a UX tweak without needing a meeting to approve it
- Pulling in the right stakeholder before anyone asks
- Shipping the draft, not waiting until it’s perfect
- Asking the client what’s *really* blocking progress, then offering a solution

These actions build trust. They make the client feel like someone finally has their back.

### Don’t Confuse Recklessness with Initiative

This doesn’t mean you should make sweeping changes without alignment. Initiative doesn’t mean acting in a vacuum. It means acting in context—with communication, judgment, and professionalism.

Use your head. Loop people in when necessary. But **don’t default to hesitation**. Default to motion. Ask yourself: “What would I do if I owned this problem?” Then do that.

### Final Thought: This Is What You We're Hired For

You were hired not just because you’re a great engineer, but because we believe you’re capable of leadership—even if you’re not holding the title yet.

So the next time you hesitate to act, ask yourself:

- Does this make the client’s life better?
- Is this something I’d be proud to stand behind?
- Does this move the project forward?

If the answer is yes, then stop waiting.

**You already have permission.**
