In this podcast episode, DJ Daugherty and Mary Kaufmann are joined by Mark Tremayne, the Director of Innovation and Extended Learning for Hilliard City Schools, discussing the school district’s forward-thinking approach to technology education, student engagement, and workforce readiness.

### Episode Highlights:

**Opening Remarks and Introductions:**

- DJ humorously begins by correcting a mistake from the previous episode, where he misstated the episode number, and introduces Mary Kaufmann, his co-host. Together, they welcome Mark, who oversees innovative learning initiatives for Hilliard City Schools.
- Mark introduces himself and his role in overseeing strategic programming across grades pre-K through 12, focusing on preparing students for their future by exposing them to a variety of learning experiences aimed at developing problem-solving, critical thinking, and technical skills.

### The Mission of Hilliard Schools:

- Mark emphasizes Hilliard’s mission, "Ready for Tomorrow," which reflects the school’s goal to ensure that every student is prepared for the next step in their educational or career journey.
- He describes the innovation-focused programming that helps students develop both academic and practical skills through partnerships with local businesses and tech companies.

**Partnerships with the Community and OhioX Tech Day:**

- DJ discusses the long-standing collaboration between the school district and the city of Hilliard, noting the partnership’s role in programs like **OhioX Tech Day**, which provides hands-on tech experiences for students. Each year, students participate in activities that give them exposure to different aspects of technology.
- Mark explains that the event offers students the chance to engage with real-world tech projects, helping them understand the practical applications of the skills they learn in school. The switch from hardware to software projects this year, based on student feedback, demonstrates how the program adapts to student interests and the evolving tech landscape.

### Problem-Solving and Experiential Learning:

- The conversation dives deeper into how critical problem-solving skills are essential for students, not just in technology but in all walks of life. Mary shares a personal story about how learning basic programming in high school ignited her passion for technology, demonstrating how small experiences can shape a student's entire career path.
- Mark emphasizes the importance of helping students “see it before they can be it,” referring to giving students exposure to careers in technology so they can visualize themselves in those roles. The school aims to provide students with an authentic audience, access to experts, and problem-solving challenges that reflect real-life situations.

**Creating a Dynamic Learning Environment:**

- A key topic is the **Hilliard Innovation Campus**, where students can explore a variety of learning paths through integrated and hands-on projects. The campus offers programs in **STEM, STEAM**, and subjects like entrepreneurship, technology, art, and business. Students participate in programs that mix academic core subjects with technology-based learning, fostering a collaborative environment where they can explore careers in fields like engineering, music production, and software development.
- Mark discusses how students are shuttled to the Innovation Campus in two-period blocks, allowing them to integrate these specialized courses into their regular school day, ensuring that they can benefit from unique learning experiences without disconnecting from their core academic requirements.

### Engaging Students with Different Interests and Abilities:

- Addressing the common misconception that students need to excel in math or science to succeed in tech, Mark emphasizes that technology education is accessible to everyone. The skills students need—such as problem-solving and collaboration—are cultivated through hands-on experiences, regardless of their initial comfort level with technology.
- He shares a strategy used by Hilliard schools, known as "first attempt in learning" (FAIL), which reframes failure as a part of the learning process. This mindset encourages students to approach challenges without fear, understanding that learning and growth often come from mistakes.

### Support for Diverse Learners and Parents:

- Mark outlines the comprehensive support systems available for students who may need additional help, including individualized education plans (IEPs) and intervention programs designed to keep all students on track toward achieving success.
- The school district also actively involves parents, offering **parent universities** and community events to ensure they understand the opportunities available to their children and can support them in pursuing their passions.

**Expanding Career Opportunities and Credentials:**

- Mark highlights the district's ambition to help students earn professional credentials while still in high school, such as certifications in JavaScript or other technical skills. These credentials can set students apart in the job market, allowing them to secure high-paying roles or internships even before they graduate.
- He mentions that some students have used these programs as a springboard into internships and jobs with major companies, making up to $35 an hour as high school seniors, which helps reduce the financial burden of higher education.

### Personalized Learning and Workforce Development:

- The conversation shifts to the broader vision for integrating education and workforce development. Mark explains how Hilliard City Schools work closely with local economic development teams to align their educational programs with the needs of the community’s job market.
- DJ reflects on a personal story where his son, through experience, learned that while he didn’t enjoy programming, he was passionate about technology infrastructure. This underscores the value of giving students real-world experiences to help them discover their true interests and career paths.

### Girls in STEM and the Power of Representation:

- Mark shares an exciting upcoming event, a **Girls Tech Day**, which will focus on inspiring young girls to pursue careers in technology. This event is part of a broader effort to ensure that underrepresented groups, including women, have access to role models and opportunities in the tech industry.

### Long-Term Vision and Future Goals:

- Mark speaks about the importance of continuing to evolve and expand these programs. He expresses excitement about the possibility of scaling credential programs to allow more students to graduate high school with certifications that could immediately benefit them in the job market.
- He envisions a future where every student has access to these kinds of transformative experiences, and where the school district, businesses, and the community are closely aligned in developing the workforce of tomorrow.

### Conclusion:

- The podcast wraps up with DJ and Mary expressing their admiration for Mark's work and dedication to preparing students for the future. They discuss how these educational innovations align with broader goals of fostering creativity, collaboration, and adaptability in a rapidly changing world.
- Mark’s message is one of collaboration, advocating that no school district can achieve this kind of transformation alone. He stresses the importance of partnerships with local businesses and the role of educators in building pathways for students to succeed in an increasingly complex world.

### Takeaway:

This episode is an inspiring look into how one school district is innovating the way education is delivered, making it more experiential, practical, and relevant to the modern workforce. By focusing on real-world skills like problem-solving, collaboration, and adaptability, Hilliard City Schools are helping students prepare for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow, regardless of their background or starting point.
