At Augustwenty, we believe that hiring new employees is more than just filling vacancies—it’s about fostering a culture that inspires innovation, creativity, and teamwork. Our hiring process is built around three core pillars: **cultural alignment**, **skills assessment**, and **growth potential**. Here’s a look at how we approach recruiting new talent.

### Embracing Flexibility

Rather than defining a rigid role from the outset, we encourage new team members to bring their best selves. This process allows individuals to identify how their unique skills can best contribute to our company’s goals and vision. By allowing employees to carve out their own path, we create a more dynamic environment that fosters innovation and ensures people can thrive in roles they define for themselves. This approach attracts candidates who are eager to take ownership in their impact from day one.

### Cultural Alignment: Finding the Right Fit

Our culture is everything. We believe that people thrive in environments where they can be themselves while contributing to shared goals. When we interview candidates, we focus on finding individuals who resonate with the following traits:

* Collaboration and teamwork
* Curiosity and innovation
* Adaptability and resilience

We seek candidates who demonstrate a passion for their work, a willingness to challenge the status quo, and the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. Cultural fit is assessed through behavioral interview questions, informal conversations with team members, and a general sense of whether the candidate can align with the company's ethos. We are also not just looking for a ‘cultural fit’, but a ‘cultural add’... we want candidates that are going to make us grow as well.

### Skills Assessment: Ensuring Technical Proficiency

While cultural fit is critical, we also ensure candidates have the skills required for the role. Our skills assessment process often involves:

* Technical interviews for engineering and development roles, where candidates solve real-world problems and demonstrate their coding proficiency.
* Portfolio reviews for creative roles, allowing us to assess the quality and originality of their previous work.
* Task-based evaluations where candidates complete a job-related task, helping us see how they perform under realistic conditions.

This part of the process ensures that potential employees not only fit in culturally but also have the capability to meet the demands of the role.

### Growth Potential: Investing in the Future

We’re not just hiring for the present—we’re hiring for the future. We seek individuals who are committed to learning and personal growth. We look for candidates with:

* **A growth mindset**, who are eager to take on new challenges and expand their skill set.
* **Leadership potential**, even for entry-level positions, as we prefer to promote from within whenever possible.
* **A desire to innovate**, since we are constantly evolving to stay at the forefront of industry trends.

During interviews, we ask questions about long-term goals, problem-solving strategies, and how candidates handle feedback, all to gauge their potential for growth within the company.

### The A20 Way: Our Guiding Philosophy

One of the most important aspects of our hiring process is what we call **The A20 Way**. This philosophy is central to everything we do. It emphasizes:

* **Agility**: We look for individuals who can adapt quickly in an ever-changing industry and thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments.
* **Client-Centered Thinking**: Every decision we make is driven by what’s best for our clients. We hire team members who put the client first and can think creatively to solve their challenges.
* **Accountability**: Ownership is a key part of The A20 Way. We want people who take responsibility for their work and are proud to see their contributions reflected in the company’s growth.
* **Excellence**: Continuous improvement and striving for excellence are ingrained in our company culture. The A20 Way requires every employee to push the boundaries of what’s possible, every day.

When we evaluate candidates, we assess how well they align with these core principles. Those who embody The A20 Way are more than just employees—they are future leaders who will help us maintain our high standards and client-focused approach.

### Collaboration and Transparency: A Multi-Stage Interview Process

Hiring is a collaborative effort. We involve various stakeholders in the hiring process, including team leads, peers, and the CEO. This ensures that every hire is the right fit for the broader team, not just for the immediate position.

Our multi-stage interview process is designed to assess both cultural fit and technical competency. It typically involves:

* **Initial screening** to gauge interest and background.
* **Interviews with team members** to ensure cultural alignment and technical skills.
* **Final round with leadership** to confirm fit with the company’s long-term vision.

Throughout the process, we maintain transparency with candidates, offering feedback and keeping them informed of their status.

### Onboarding and Integration: A Warm Welcome

Once hired, we go the extra mile to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. New employees are introduced to the team, equipped with the tools they need, and paired with a mentor to help them acclimate quickly. We aim to create an inclusive and welcoming environment from day one.

### Conclusion: Building the Future Together

Our hiring process reflects our commitment to nurturing talent and building a team that’s capable of driving our mission forward. By focusing on cultural alignment, technical skills, and growth potential—along with the guiding principles of **The A20 Way**—we ensure that each new employee can contribute meaningfully to our success.

We understand that our people are our greatest asset, and every hire is a step toward a brighter, more innovative future.
