In this episode of the augustwenty podcast, DJ and Mary dive into the theme “Stop and Smell the Roses: Celebrating Success.” With the year winding down and the company several years into its journey, the hosts reflect on what it means to recognize wins—both large and small—and how this recognition fuels motivation and progress.

They start by acknowledging that when a business is new, every victory feels monumental: signing the first client, finalizing a workable contract, or building a stable foundational team. Over time, these once-major hurdles become routine, and the question arises: How do you keep everyone energized, engaged, and pushing forward when the “big firsts” are no longer new?

The conversation highlights the importance of celebrating small wins and acknowledging everyday accomplishments. While DJ admits he’s not naturally inclined to big, public celebrations—he’s more of the “what’s next?” mindset—Mary emphasizes that recognition can serve as vital “fuel in the tank.” People differ in their motivational triggers; some are internally driven, content with quiet acknowledgement, while others thrive on more public forms of praise.

Mary introduces a key insight: human beings need belonging, purpose, love, understanding, significance, and safety to stay motivated. Celebrating successes, no matter how modest, helps feed these innate needs. It’s not about constant, grandiose events, but about the subtle, consistent signals that a person’s work is valued. Even minor gestures—like a shout-out channel or a casual team lunch—can nurture a sense of purpose and progress.

The hosts also discuss generational and cultural shifts in expectations. The instant gratification of today’s world can shape how teams view recognition and success. Striking a balance is crucial. Over-celebrating mundane tasks can erode meaning, but under-celebrating real achievements can sap motivation. The goal is to understand each team member, align recognition with their values, and maintain a steady flow of “mental fuel.”

Ultimately, DJ and Mary agree that success celebration is not one-size-fits-all. It’s about understanding what truly matters to individuals and teams. By paying attention to what people need to feel significant and purposeful, leaders can tailor their approach—sometimes celebrating openly, other times offering a quiet nod—so that everyone stays engaged, energized, and ready for what’s next.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Recognize that success and its celebration evolve over time.
- Tailor recognition to individual and team needs—some prefer quiet acknowledgment, others enjoy public praise.
- Small, consistent signs of appreciation help maintain motivation and momentum.
- Balancing acknowledgment (fueling forward progress) with realism (avoiding empty praise) leads to a healthier, more purposeful work environment.
- Knowing what truly matters to your people—and to your clients—drives sustainable, meaningful success.
