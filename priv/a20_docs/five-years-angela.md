The idea for augustwenty came about completely by chance. DJ and I had never discussed starting a company—until one day, the company we both worked for was acquired, and suddenly, we were out of jobs.

*What could be next?* That question sparked everything.

We gathered with some of our past co-workers to test the waters, and the response was overwhelming. After a few conversations (and some convincing), a couple of friends believed in us enough to invest. Just like that, the journey began.

#### Building More Than a Business

The hardest part wasn’t the decision to start a company—it was defining what we wanted it to be. Choosing a name, shaping the “how,” and articulating the “why” took time and intention.

From those conversations, augustwenty’s foundation was built—our core values, beliefs, goals, and, of course, our name.

That was **August 20th, 2020**.

Since then, we’ve grown from three employees to thirty-eight. We’ve partnered with organizations facing challenges both big and small, and we’ve done it all with the same commitment: to serve our clients while creating an environment where our employees feel valued. At augustwenty, we call this *living our values*—**trust, creativity, and transparency**.

#### The Challenges That Shaped Us

The journey hasn’t been easy. We’ve navigated the uncertainty of COVID, shifting political and economic climates, and the challenge of hiring during a time when engineer salaries skyrocketed. Each obstacle gave us a new perspective on what it truly means to *build relationships*.

Through it all, one thing never wavered: our dedication to building meaningful solutions and supporting the people who make them possible.

#### Looking Ahead

Today, we’re proud of how far we’ve come—but we know our story is still being written. We’re focused on creating valuable outcomes for our clients in the way that works best for them—not us. We’re challenging ourselves intellectually, improving the way we share our story, and pushing forward with the same grit and heart that got us here.

We didn’t plan on starting augustwenty, but we are absolutely planning to keep it.

**Cheers to 5 years—and to all the years ahead.**
