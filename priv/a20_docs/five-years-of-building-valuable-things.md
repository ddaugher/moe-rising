Five years ago, we filed the paperwork. No logo. No website. Not even a name we fully agreed on. What we *did* have was a belief — that consulting could be done differently. More honest. More clear. More focused on building things that actually matter.

Today, Augustwenty is more than just a company. It’s a team. A body of work. A place where good people come together to do meaningful work, thoughtfully and intentionally.

We got here because a few early clients said yes when every reason said “not yet.” They gave us a chance before we had much to show, and we’re still grateful for that trust. It gave us space to prove something we’ve always believed: great consulting doesn’t have to be flashy — it has to be thoughtful, deliberate, and real.

We also had people behind the scenes — friends, former colleagues, mentors — who didn’t just cheer us on but helped make it real. Some even invested in us when all we had was conviction. Their belief gave us the room to take risks, build our foundation, and grow. We wouldn’t be here without them.

Since then, the work has spoken for itself:

- Helping **nuCamp** connect campers through an app that builds community off the road.
- Building with **Finite State** to secure billions of connected devices with a scalable API platform.
- Powering **RevLocal** with a marketing platform that automated workflows for thousands of clients.
- Partnering with **Path Robotics** to bring AI-powered welding robots to life — and helping their teams move faster while doing it.
- Modernizing fountain infrastructure with the **City of Hilliard** — a local win that still makes us smile.
- Pushing into high-security, real-time data protection with **DataAnchor** and the Department of Defense.

Different contexts. Different challenges. Same thread: the work mattered — and so did the way we showed up.

Through it all, we’ve kept asking the same question: *Are we building something valuable?*
If the answer wasn’t clear, we slowed down. If the answer was no, we changed course. That standard has been our compass since day one.

But here’s the truth: none of it happens without the people who choose to build this with us. Our team — engineers, designers, strategists, consultants — bring curiosity, integrity, and an incredible amount of care to every engagement. They ask hard questions. They hold high standards. They take ownership. They care.

And to our clients: thank you. Not just for the business, but for the partnership. You’ve let us into your challenges, your companies, sometimes your chaos — and you’ve trusted us to make things clearer and stronger. That trust is the foundation of everything we do.

Looking ahead, the landscape is shifting fast. AI, automation, distributed teams, new delivery models — they all bring opportunity and risk. But our approach doesn’t change:

- Invest in craft.
- Solve real problems.
- Show up with clarity, honesty, and intention.

The next five years won’t be about chasing trends. They’ll be about doing the work — the kind that makes businesses stronger and people better at what they do.

If I’ve learned one thing, it’s this: tools and processes matter, but people are everything. You can’t fake what this team brings to the table — and you can’t replace it.

Five years in, and in many ways, we’re just getting started.
