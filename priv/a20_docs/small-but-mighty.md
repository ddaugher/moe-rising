In this podcast episode, the augustwenty team — DJ, Mary, and Beth — hosts two guests from the Riverview International Center (RIC) in Columbus, Ohio:
Executive Director Emelia and Community Care Coordinator Hamida. Emelia explains how RIC began in a tiny apartment helping immigrant women with everyday needs,
eventually growing into a nonprofit that now serves over 1,800 people a year from dozens of countries. Hamida shares her personal story of moving to the U.S.
from Algeria through the Diversity Visa Lottery, revealing the challenges her family faced in adapting to a new language and culture. Together, they describe
RIC’s range of services, from job readiness classes and community care (like enrolling children in Medicaid) to helping credentialed professionals navigate the
path toward working in their fields. Throughout the conversation, the hosts and guests emphasize the importance of resilience, trust, and the power of community
support—underscoring how RIC’s “small but mighty” team of nine staff and over 200 volunteers has transformed countless immigrant and refugee lives in central Ohio.
